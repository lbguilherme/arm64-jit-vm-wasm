# arm64-jit-vm-wasm

This is a virtual machine capable of running full ASM64 operating systems quickly and efficiently. It is an emulator that will translate instructions on the fly (JIT) to WebAssembly. This can run in the browser, on iOS devices, or anywhere JavaScript is supported.

This is a very early prototype and proof of concept. It is not yet functional.

Inspired by the excellent [copy/v86](https://github.com/copy/v86).
